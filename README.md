# Allostery_Pred

- Repository for Predicting Allosteric Pathways in Proteins using Deep Learning.
- The goal of this project is to predict allosteric pathways (pathways through which proteins communicate) using Molecular Dynamics and Deep Learning.
- Uses the Neural Relational Inference Model [Kipf et al., 2018](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/kipf18a/kipf18a.pdf) to generate inputs for the overall model.
- Extracts Embeddings for the input dataset using ESM2, ProstT5, ProtBert, SSM-emb
